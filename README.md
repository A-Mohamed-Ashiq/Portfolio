#### Background
The global tourism industry, including Destination Management Organisations (DMOs), has undergone profound changes due to the recent COVID-19 pandemic. Throughout various stages of lockdown and even in the post-lockdown era, there have been notable shifts in practices, customer behaviours, and expectations across the industry. Many organisations failed to adapt in time, and tourism suffered.

#### Motivation
Considering possible new lockdowns from a resurgence of covid 19 cases or from new diseases, DMOs must examine and comprehend these emerging trends and adaptations thoroughly. By doing so, they can effectively strategize and implement measures to enhance their business performance and ensure long-term success should a new lockdown be imposed.

#### Business Problem 
The business problem is that DMOs cannot identify content strategies or upload schedules (I.e. what kinds of tweets or during business hours or not) that will result in positive sentiments during different phases of the pandemic. Thus, the business objective is to accurately predict if a tweet can generate strong sentiments in social media users that react to their social media content strategy during the different phases.

#### Objective
The data mining objective will be to predict if a particular post can invoke positive sentiments in social media users using predictive models like **logistic regressions** and **decision trees** etc, and then analyse the splitting criteria to better understand what can invoke positive sentiments in users and help inform strategies. 

#### Data Quality 
There is an error in the calculation of the total sentiment values and corrected this error by adding “Positive” and “Negative” values to Corrected_Sentoment.
